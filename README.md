#   Exam AHCI
This project done by Michele Minniti and Giuseppe Grisolia (first two deliveries) is about a software reliezed for attention control and speech to image generation
The project was evaluated mainly on the attention control method, for which we realized an analysis.py file to plot features in time windows and frame by frame to analyze the behaviour from two different detectors: deepface/gazetracking (which are used also in the final version of the app), and openface (used as baseline but with no real time application)

To install dependencies
```
conda env create -f studioassistant.yaml
